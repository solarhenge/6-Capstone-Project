# PROJECT SPECIFICATION
## Data Engineering Capstone

### Write Up

|CRITERIA|MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|
|--------|--------------------|
|Scoping the Project|The write up includes an outline of the steps taken in the project. The purpose of the final data model is made explicit.
|Addressing Other Scenarios|The write up describes a logical approach to this project under the following scenarios:
|| * The data was increased by 100x.
|| * The pipelines would be run on a daily basis by 7 am every day.
|| * The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.
|Defending Decisions|The choice of tools, technologies, and data model are justified well.

### Execution

|CRITERIA|MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|
|--------|--------------------|
|Project code is clean and modular.|All coding scripts have an intuitive, easy-to-follow structure with code separated into logical functions. Naming for variables and functions follows the PEP8 style guidelines. The code should run without errors.
|Quality Checks|The project includes at least two data quality checks.
|Data Model|* The ETL processes result in the data model outlined in the write-up.
|| * A data dictionary for the final data model is included.
|| * The data model is appropriate for the identified purpose.
|Datasets|The project includes:
|| * At least 2 data sources
|| * More than 1 million lines of data.
|| * At least two data sources/formats (csv, api, json)

### Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
```
To make your project stand out:

* Work with large amounts of data.
* Combine datasets that are difficult to combine.
* Enrich the data from several disparate sources.
* Include recommendations for how to use to data to come up with insights.
* Write a blog post about your project and link to it.
